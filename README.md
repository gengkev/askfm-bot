This bot was designed to run on Google App Engine, and automatically reply to
questions posed to it on ask.fm by acting whenever an email notification was
received. Unfortunately, ask.fm changed its internal APIs around a lot after it
was acquired, so this probably won't work anymore.

This bot lived briefly as the account [WonseokBot](http://ask.fm/WonseokBot),
with apologies to Wonseok and a fair share of blame put on
[mabotkin](https://github.com/mabotkin) for even giving me this idea. ;)
Actually, I don't even know if it's still running, because have no idea what
happened to the App Engine project that I hosted it on, but whatever.
